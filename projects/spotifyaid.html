            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>I built a spotify aid that shows users their top artists & tracks, allows users to
                view statistical data about their favorite songs, artists, and albums, and more.

            <h2>KEY POINTS</h2>
            <p>•Built a Spotify tool that allows users to view & manage their profile, which displays
                their playlists, followers, the artists they follow, their tracks, and more.
            </p>
            <p>•Made GET/POST requests to the Spotify Web API to retreive statistical data on
                any track a user would like to look up, along with their own top tracks & artists.
            </p>
            <p>•Handled Spotify user authentication tokens in Node.js by making GET/POST requests to Spotify's REST API
                and storing the access/refresh tokens in browser cookies to prevent malicious logins.
            </p>
            <p>•Learned & utilized Sass and tied it to a React.js front end.

            <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
            <p>While participating in a Open World Builders bootcamp during late July and August of 2020,
                I knew I wanted to try and complete one more project before school started, so I could
                enter school which multiple projects that I could touch up on and re-style over time.
                I also wanted to further solidify my knowledge of working with REST APIs all while learning Sass
                and further improving my skills in React.js.
            </p>
            <p>I knew I wanted to to something with music because it's a great way to tie many components
                together. I could have the ability to try and prove my formatting & styling skills with React.js
                and Sass
                while working with Spotify's wonderful Web API, which has great explanations of how to get
                started. As a bonus, I had been listening to music over quarantine with my dad,
                and I would love to make something music related for him.
            </p>
            <p>SpotifyAid is a great tool to have alongside the data Spotify already provides you. With SpotifyAid
                you can easily view all of your top tracks & artists and get a sense of what kind of music you love.
                Each
                track and artist has statistical data on its popularity, genre, and other specific stats such as
                energy, liveliness, and more. You can also look up any track you want to see how it compares to
                the songs you already listen to and love.
